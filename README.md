here i didnot put the files of librarries 
you need to setup by yourself 
all files are related to tensorflow 
you need to add nvidia cuda for extra speed in image generation 
i used hugging face for first image generation u need to api key for it but not for the second one 
pipelines are cositive so i think in clonning without set up pipelines joins u may trouble so install it by local 
i am as well as upload in google collab u can go through it
